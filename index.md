## Introduction
I currently work as a Machine Learning Researcher at [Rasa](https://rasa.com/research/), where we are building the standard infrastructure for conversational AI.

Before joining Rasa, I was a Research Associate at the [Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR)](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk). I worked on the [Ultrax2020](http://www.ultrax-speech.org/research/ultrax-2020) project automating speech and language therapy using machine learning. I also supervised a number of Informatics MSc students.

Prior to that, I was a Senior Statistics Software Engineer at [Quantics Biostatistics](https://www.quantics.co.uk) where I developed as part of a team a commercial software for the statistical modelling and analysis of Bioassay data ([QuBAS](https://www.quantics.co.uk/qubas-bioassay-software/)). During my time there I also worked on a number of statistical consulting projects for pharmaceutical clients. 

Before joining Quantics, I worked as a Researched Associate at the [Institute of Perception, Action and Behaviour](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ipab).

In 2014, I received my PhD from the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation (ILCC)](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc) at the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk). My thesis focussed on modelling goal-directed users in task-oriented dialogs as generative probabilistic models. I was supervised by [Mark Steedman](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/steedman/), and co-supervised by [Subramanian Ramamoorthy](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sramamoo/).
